## Overview

[Gravity Bridge](https://www.gravitybridge.net/) - an independent and credibly neutral Cosmos-SDK blockchain providing the entire SDK community with a neutral bridge to Ethereum and eventually all major EVM chains.

The bridge currently supports bridging of CUDOS tokens between the Ethereum and Cudos ecosystems, the bridge will be able to support any ERC-20 or ERC-721 asset to be bridged in the future.

## Bridging CUDOS

The Gravity Bridge is available for token holders via a web interface which allows any user on either network to bridge ERC-20 CUDOS tokens.

When using the web interface a user can connect to either side of the bridge using either [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), or [Keplr](/build/account-setup.html#what-is-keplr), depending on the direction required. The bridging mechanism requires a transaction and signature from the sender location (so this side needs to be connected via a wallet) and the receiver is a simple public address to send the tokens to.

For example if a user wanted to send CUDOS from Ethereum to Cudos Network:
1. Make this selection from the dropdown menus
2. Enter an amount of CUDOS you wish to send between these ecosystems
3. Enter a destination address - this is where the CUDOS will be deposited after the bridge, it can be an account you control or any other. The address will follow the standard CosmosSDK format and look something like `cudos1hutad4hec0rnw7plhzd2ywmdjh06pqsd86vu5x`

If a user wanted to send CUDOS from Cudos back to Ethereum:
1. Make this selection from the dropdown menus
2. Enter an amount of CUDOS you wish to send between these ecosystems
3. Enter a destination address - this is where the CUDOS will be deposited after the bridge, it can be an account you control or any other. The address will follow the standard Ethereum address format and look something like `0xfD619F91C38A86be881d8eD4B8ef88De1E1afD50`

<!-- TODO: add a new '## Architecture' section with diagrams explaining how this works technically: Orchestrators, Queues, Data flow, decentralised in nature --> 

###¬†NFT Bridge

Coming soon.. üòè

#### Somniorum Bridge

In the public testnet Somniorum the Gravity Bridge connects from Somniorum to Rinkeby Ethereum so test assets can be moved between these two ecosystems.

::: tip
The bridge is currently available [here](http://35.192.177.142:4000/) for testing.

Make sure you are connected to the correct network RPC endpoints via the connected wallets (`Rinkeby` & `CudosPublicTestnet`)

#### Ingenii Bridge

Once the mainnet Cudos Network is deployed the Gravity Bridge will connect to mainnet Ethereum for real-world bridging of token assets

## Bridge Security

The Gravity Bridge mechanism is a decentralised interface relying on a distributed series of Orchestrator Nodes that sit across these ecosystems. These nodes are incentivised to behave properly using a stake-based slashing policy

The slashing policy is described in the resources below. In short the slashing is defined by the validator (*the node which actually signs each block*) not by the orchestrator (*the helper binary which is running along side the validator's node*).

Not having enough funds in a validator's orchestrator account results in the orchestrator not running.

If orchestrator is not running:

1. The validator does not have a chance for a reward.
2. The validator will not receive any information about what has to be signed so he will not sign anything.

If a validator does not sign an operation (*valset update, batch confirm, logical call confirm*) in a fixed period of time (*defined in **genesis.json** with default value 10000 blocks*) then he is slashed. This may happen, because of the following conditions:

1. Does not have a running orchestrator ‚áí the validator will not be aware of what he has to sign.
2. Is running an old/wrong binary and is/is not signing wrong operations.

There is a little catch especially about batches. Once a batch is submitted to the Ethereum (*has been signed by less than 2/3 of the voting power*) then it is deleted from the database. Once the batch is deleted, there is no way to check whether a validator hasn't signed it. In short - if a validator couldn't sign a batch for some reason and if this batch had been submitted to the Ethereum then the validator who hasn't signed it, will not be slashed.

### Slashing Parameters for the Network

Parameter defining the size (*number of blocks*) of the sliding window used to track validator liveness:
```
slashing.params: {
"signed_blocks_window": "400",
```

Parameter defining the time that validator is jailed for not passing the ckeck for liveness:
```
"min_signed_per_window": "0.1",
"downtime_jail_duration": "600s",
```

Fraction to multiply to sum of validator holdings to be taken when bad signing on valset:
```
"slash_fraction_double_sign": "0.050000000000000000",
"slash_fraction_downtime": "0.010000000000000000"
},
"slash_fraction_valset": "0.001000000000000000",
```

Fraction to multiply to sum of validator holdings to be taken when bad signing on batch:
```
"slash_fraction_batch": "0.001000000000000000",
```

Fraction to multiply to sum of validator holdings to be taken when bad signing on logic call:
```
"slash_fraction_logic_call": "0.001000000000000000",
```

(blocks) The time needed to the node that was validator to run after declaring that he is no longer a validator:
```
"unbond_slashing_valsets_window": "10000",
```

The fraction percent that will be taken from validator:
```
"slash_fraction_bad_eth_signature": "0.001000000000000000",
```

At any given time, there are any number of validators registered in the state machine. In each block, the top **MaxValidators** (*defined by x/staking*) who are not jailed become bonded, meaning that they may propose and vote on blocks. Validators who are bonded are at stake, meaning that part or all of their stake and their delegators' stake is at risk if they commit a protocol fault.

### Infraction Timelines

To illustrate how the **x/slashing** module handles submitted evidence through Tendermint consensus, consider the following examples:

#### Definitions:

**[:** timeline start <br/>
**]**: timeline end <br/>
**Cn**: infraction n committed <br/>
**Dn**: infraction n discovered <br/>
**Vb**: validator bonded <br/>
**Vu**: validator unbonded <br/>

#### Single Double Sign Infraction:

<-----------------> [-------------C1--------D1,Vu-----] <br/>

#### Multiple Double Sign Infractions:

<---------------------------> [----------C1---C2---C3---D1,D2,D3Vu-----] <br/>

Multiple infractions are committed and then later discovered, at which point the validator is jailed and slashed for only one infraction. Because the validator is also tombstoned, they can not rejoin the validator set.

Slashing will occur when a validator has joined the network, but doesn't have Gravity bridge components. In this case after 16 hours the validator will be slashed and removed from the set of validators.

### Liveness Tracking

At the beginning of each block, we update the **ValidatorSigningInfo** for each validator and check if they've crossed below the liveness threshold over a sliding window. This sliding window is defined by **SignedBlocksWindow** and the index in this window is determined by **IndexOffset** found in the validator's **ValidatorSigningInfo**. For each block processed, the **IndexOffset** is incremented regardless if the validator signed or not. Once the index is determined, the **MissedBlocksBitArray** and **MissedBlocksCounter** are updated accordingly.

Finally, in order to determine if a validator crosses below the liveness threshold, we fetch the maximum number of blocks missed, **maxMissed**, which is **SignedBlocksWindow** - (*MinSignedPerWindow * SignedBlocksWindow*) and the minimum height at which we can determine liveness, **minHeight**. If the current block is greater than **minHeight** and the validator's **MissedBlocksCounter** is greater than **maxMissed**, they will be slashed by **SlashFractionDowntime**, will be jailed for **DowntimeJailDuration**, and have the following values reset: **MissedBlocksBitArray, MissedBlocksCounter,** and **IndexOffset**.

In the current implementation of the slashing module, when the consensus engine informs the state machine of a validator's consensus fault, the validator is partially slashed, and put into a **"jail period"**, a period of time in which they are not allowed to rejoin the validator set. However, because of the nature of consensus faults and ABCI, there can be a delay between an infraction occurring, and evidence of the infraction reaching the state machine (this is one of the primary reasons for the existence of the unbonding period).

The maximum number of slashing periods is the **len(UnbondingPeriod) / len(JailPeriod)**.

The current defaults in Cosmos Network for the **UnbondingPeriod** and **JailPeriod** are 3 weeks and 2 days, respectively.
