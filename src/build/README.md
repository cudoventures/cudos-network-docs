## Somniorum Testnet

The Cudos Network is currently in a public testnet entitled 'Somniorum' ([See why 🌝](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacus_Somniorum)). The guides in this section describe how to get setup on Somniorum and begin building decentralised applications that harness CUDOS.

Developers can start building smart contracts on Somniorum today and be ready to launch their products at launch of Cudos Network mainnet.

[Start a Somniorum Validator](/build/validator.html), or [dive into our docs now to start building!](/build/smart-contracts.html)

## Ingenii Mainnet

As per our roadmap the Cudos Network will go into production at the conclusion of our incentivised public testnet [Project Artemis](/earn/incentives.html). 'Ingenii' allows Validators to begin earning CUDOS for transaction processing and allows developers to build production smart contract functionality for their decentralised applications.
